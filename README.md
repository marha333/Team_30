### Git workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Set up the remote upstream `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sw21-tug/Team_30.git`
3. Always pull from the upstream before you start with a new branch `git pull upstream main`
4. Checkout your current feature branch on the forked repository `git checkout -b SR-XXX`
5. Commit your changes and stick to the commiting convention `git commit -m "SR-XXX <short description>"`

   If you worked in pair programming, don't forget to add your initials! Your initials must be in alphabetical order depending on your first name like in the following example: `git commit -m "SR-XXX <short description> [SJ,DM]"` where SJ stands for Jim SMITH and DM for Mary DOE
   
6. Push your changes to your feature branch and create a pull-request.
